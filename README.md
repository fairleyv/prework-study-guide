# Prework Study Guide webpage

## Description

A study guide made up of notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript that were accumulated through the prework. 
The motivation for this project was to provide a resource to look back at and a way to help build and refine my 
skills as a webdeveloper. This project helped me to relearn some of the basic skills that I need to change my career
and helped me to learn some new javascript.
